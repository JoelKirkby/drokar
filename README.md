## How to play
The objective of the game is to level up your adventure, gather resources and create powerful items to defeat monsters.

### Getting started
Click on Prospecting or Metallurgy to start a task or start fighting from the Combat window. You cannot work on tasks while in combat and vice versa.
Mine ores with Prospecting, these ores can be refined using the Metallurgy skill.
Using Metallurgy, refine ores and turn them into powerful weapons and armor that will enhance your combat stats when fighting monsters! 

For skills such as Prospecting and Metallurgy, you will unlock more tasks as you level up your skills.

Original composition "Where Is Home" can be played as background music.
